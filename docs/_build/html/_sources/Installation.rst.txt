Prerequisites::
    Install the most recent version of PsychoPy (https://www.psychopy.org/download.html).

    You will also need VLC media player in order to play media. It is free. (https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html)

    On Windows, you may need to install some movie codecs into PsychoPy directly. See :doc:`WindowsTroubleshooting`

Download the latest release of PyHab as a .zip file (https://github.com/jfkominsky/PyHab/releases).

Unzip the folder anywhere you would like. Then, see :doc:`Quickstart`
